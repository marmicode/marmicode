Two ways to keep your app stable:
**Leave it untouched — or season it with a solid testing strategy.**

How's your testing strategy holding up?
- Does each refactor send half your tests into meltdown?
- Maintaining mocks turns into a nightmare?
- Got 100% coverage but bugs still sneak through the cracks?
- Thought end-to-end would be the main course — but ended up chewing on flakiness and wait times?
- As release dates approach, you skip tests and serve it raw, hoping nobody gets food poisoning?

If that sounds familiar, this workshop is your kitchen rescue plan.

We'll shop for the good stuff: **Fakes, Object Mothers, Gloves, Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright Component Testing** — and learn when and why to reach for each.

Once we're back in the kitchen, we'll cook **high-confidence, low-maintenance** tests that:

- Help you develop faster.
- Catch regressions before your users do.
- **Survive the heat of refactors** and all sorts of **migrations** — including Observables → Signals, or whatever the future holds.
- Run fast enough to guide you while you code.
- Are ready for a **Zoneless future**.

No dogma. No silver bullets. Just pragmatic Angular testing skills to help you **ship with peace of mind**.
