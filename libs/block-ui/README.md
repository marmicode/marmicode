# Block UI

`block-ui` provides the building blocks to display content such as code, markdown, or simple text.

The reason behind the block concept is that each block group contains different blocks that are linked together by a highlight zone.

When a block group contains a markdown block and a code block, links with highlight zones (e.g. `highlight://`) will highlight the code block.
